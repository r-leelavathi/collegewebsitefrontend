            <p>Karnataka (Govt) Polytechnic was the first polytechnic to start three-year Diploma course in Polymer engineering, in our state in year 1975, and it is only one polytechnic, which is still offering Diploma in Polymer Engg.  Right from the inception our department has unique distinction in teaching and learning process, quality education, academic activities, co-curricular and extra - curricular activities.   Very good Infrastructure facilities are   provided for imparting quality practical training, by inculcating skills among the students in handling and operation of equipmentâ€™s in the field of Polymer processing lab both for Rubber and Plastic, mechanical operation Chemical testing, analysis. through well-established laboratories to cater present industrial needs. Good class rooms, experienced faculty members, creates good teaching learning atmosphere in the department, which leads to get 95- 100 % academic performance every year. This department provides needful exposure and training as per the present industrial requirements. Placements for Diploma Polymer Engg. Students will be more than 80%. The intake is 42 students every year.</p>
